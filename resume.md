## Summary of Paper

#### Scale effects of changing resolution and extent on landscape patterns

###### Abstract 

> Spatial heterogeneity of landscapes is scale-dependent, that is, the quantification and representationof spatial pattern vary with the resolution and extent. With the development of thehierarchy theory, many efforts have been made on the identification of criticality in spatial scalingto help identify proper resolution for study. Overwhelming practices have focused on landscapes oflimited scale, while most phenomena and processes emerge at large, or even global extent, whichmeans the obligation of scaling the information across scales. In this study we examine the scaleeffect of landscape metrics in a more integral spectrum of grain size among 96 landscapes with variousextent (i.e. from 25km2 up towards to 221km2), and try to figure out the consequential biasesof the landscape metrics. Results clearly show the existence of scaling domain for 15 landscape-levelmetrics, as well as critical resolution that contains the metrics within insignificant change for alandscape with a given extent. Furthermore, an invariant power law scaling relationship is foundbetween the critical resolution and the spatial extent as the critical resolution is proportional to An(n is a constant, and A is the extent) at a given error limit. The quantitative power law relation canhelp to guide the selection of spatial resolution to avoid the misrepresentation of spatial pattern andprofound biases in the further ecological progress research.
